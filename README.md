Salmonberry Pi is a group of open source hardware projects which allow the construction of cluster hardware from small to arbitrary size using Raspberry Pi platforms.  This includes the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontrollers.

The goals of this project are to provide:
- infrastructure for clustering nodes
- self-sufficient nodes by default (no 'leader')
- remotely monitoring
- remote management
- standard form factors and connectors, although perhaps repurposed

The component projects are:
- [Face CM4](https://github.com/salmonberrypi/facecm4), 8TE 3U faceplate with jacks, microSD card slot and LEDs.
- [Fruit CM4](https://github.com/salmonberrypi/fruitcm4), carrier board for CM4, general purpose compute or storage or both.
- [Graft](https://github.com/salmonberrypi/graft), development board to bring up Fruit board, allows diversion to on-board connectors for rhizome served power and signals. Can be used with or without rhizome boards. (out of date)
- [Thorn](https://github.com/salmonberrypi/thorn), passive board to protect the male plug on the Fruit or Graft boards. (out of date)
- [Rhizome](https://github.com/salmonberrypi/rhizome), life support systems and connectivity
- [Stem 3U x 160mm](https://github.com/salmonberrypi/stem_3U_160mm_X4), 3U x 160mm passive slot extension for debugging
